# EnigmaCribber
A short Python3 program to enable cribbing of Enigma-encyphered text.

If you have some ciphertext and an idea about what it might say, this program will help you deduce the rotor starting positions for a standard Army Enigma cipher.

NOTE: This script assumes that the plugboard is NOT USED. I'm no Alan Turing. Maybe I'll get to that later.

NOTE2: I'm no Guido van Rossum either. I'm a newbie at Python and this script was a means for me to get my feet wet.
